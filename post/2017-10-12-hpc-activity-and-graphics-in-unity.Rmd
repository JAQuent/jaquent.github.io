- Frankland et al. (2005) reviews that HPC ripple activity is temporally correlated with cortical slow-wave spindles in the MPFC. This could be related to the integration of memories into existing schema.
- Unity tutorial on graphics:
    + If I want to spawn objects at random locations, it would be problematic to pre-compute the lighting.
    +  Would it be a solution to be used mixed baking and have all the items, which do not change their location, as static because they have light maps?
    + Use linear colour space because it is more realistic. This goes well with using HDR. When using HDR cameras, the Tonemapping Image Effect from Standard Assets (Assets>Import Package>Effects) must be added to the camera.
