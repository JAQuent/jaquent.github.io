      <description>During our weekly lab meeting I got the following feedback pertaining to project 1 (schema-memory-VR; see here):
 I should drop mixed condition and only use unexpected or expected locations to reduce the number of conditions. Another idea was to present objects in a sequence in order to create a temporal episode. It could be interesting in this context to look at the fragmentation hypothesis (Horner &amp;amp; Burgess, 2013, 2014) and see how my VR approach can be use to examine predictions of it.</description>

      <title>Selecting and checking living/non-living words</title>

      <description>Aim Here, I am selecting 200 words for a new project called noveltyVR, in which I am going to try to study the effect of novelty on something that was learned before. In this case, it will be a list of words that were incidentally encoded in a living/non-living judgement task. I will select 200 words from a published study, look up their properties in the MRC Psycholinguistic Database and create two lists that are used as old and new stimuli in a recognition task.</description>

      <title>Analysing normative data set</title>

      <description>IntroductionThe aim of the experiment of which I present some the results here was to get expectancy values for specific objects at specific location in a virtual kitchen. There were twenty possible objects and locations. After the completing these ratings, the participants were asked to rate the overall expectancy of those objects for a kitchen. The scale ranged from -100 (unexpected) to 100 (expected) and was continuous. Here I will visualise and interpret the results.</description>

      <title>Thoughts concerning Lew &amp; Howe (2016)</title>

      <description>After examining the stimuli photos from Lew &amp;amp; Howe (2016), I came to the conclusion that even schema-irrelevant objects have more or less expected locations. For instance, placing boots in the middle of the kitchen is unusual, but putting a hat on the kitchen table is less so.

      <description> To create realistic light, set environment lighting to colour and use white. To find suitable 3D models for my virtual kitchen, I looked for models on https://archive3d.net.  </description>

      <title>HPC activity and graphics in Unity</title>

      <description>Frankland et al. (2005) reviews that HPC ripple activity is temporally correlated with cortical slow-wave spindles in the MPFC. This could be related to the integration of memories into existing schema.Unity tutorial on graphics:If I want to spawn objects at random locations, it would be problematic to pre-compute the lighting.Would it be a solution to be used mixed baking and have all the items, which do not change their location, as static because they have light maps?</description>

      <description>Use empty game objects as spawn points to spawn objects in your environment. These can be dragged to certain position in the scene without specifying points in a Cartesian coordinate system.</description>
