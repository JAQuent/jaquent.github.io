      <description>Today, I finished the data collection for schemaVR1. I collected 17 instead of 16 participants because I wanted to show the experiment to someone who then agreed to formally take part in this experiment.
The two major the results of this experiment are that the locations of objects that are generally unexpected in a kitchen are remembered better (measured by 3D location recall and 3AFC location recognition) than the locations of objects that are expected in a kitchen.</description>

      <description>Following feedback I changed the instruction for the recognition task so that they are in line with Bastin et al. (2014). The respective part of the instruction were changed to:
 If you pressed &amp;lt;&amp;lt;y&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for yes, you will need to indicate whether you recollected this by pressing &amp;lt;&amp;lt;r&amp;gt;&amp;gt; or whether this object was only familiar by pressing &amp;lt;&amp;lt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt;. You recollected an object if you see it and recall specific details about it (e.</description>
