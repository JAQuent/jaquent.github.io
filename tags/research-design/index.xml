      <title>Design analysis for noveltyVR</title>

      <description>Aim of this document Instead of frequentist statistics as planned previously, we decided to use a Bayesian framework more specifically a Sequential Bayesian Factor (SBF) analysis to examine whether the experience of novelty can enhance memory for unrelated information.
Nevertheless, I also report the power analysis that I ran, in which I am determining the necessary sample size to find an effect with a power of 95 % based on the results of Fenker et al.</description>

      <title> End of schemaVR1 and start of schemaVR2</title>

      <description>Today, I finished the data collection for schemaVR1. I collected 17 instead of 16 participants because I wanted to show the experiment to someone who then agreed to formally take part in this experiment.
The two major the results of this experiment are that the locations of objects that are generally unexpected in a kitchen are remembered better (measured by 3D location recall and 3AFC location recognition) than the locations of objects that are expected in a kitchen.</description>

      <title>Interim results and future plans</title>

      <description>I am currently caught up with collecting data for my first experiment, which I will henceforth call schemaVR1, working on my first year report and analysing the interim results. I have collected data from eight participant so far and already got number of significant results. This is quite impressive considering that I also have only twenty stimuli/trials. I will upload the pre-processing script alongside a script analysing the interim results in the next days in a separate GitHub repository, where I will provide more details, but a very robust, and already significant, finding is that the locations of unexpected objects are recalled more often than that of expected objects.</description>

      <title>3D location recall task in VR</title>
      <link>https://jaquent.github.io/2018/02/3d-location-recall-task-in-vr/</link>

      <description>As noted in the previous post, I want to create a 3D location recall task. I want that people are able to pick up objects from the floor and place them at the locations at which they think the objects were during encoding.
I found a good YouTube tutorial (see here) and adapted the respective script (see here), which needs to be added to the wand controllers to work. My version of the script will be uploaded later when it finished.</description>

      <title>Final design of schemaVR1</title>

      <description>My supervisor and I agreed on the final design while discussing the results of the pilot experiment. We both think that it is important to replicate Lew &amp;amp; Howe (2016) results if their test is used, but not if one uses 3AFC test. They used a Y/N location recognition task (“Was this object in this place before?”) and location recall task (2D picture version). I will develop a spatial 3D location recall task for the VR system to replicate the results in the first experiment.</description>

      <title>Issue with stimulus selection and some thoughts</title>

      <description>This entry contains thoughts and observations for the last couple of days because I was stuck with a problem and didn’t have a lot say. The problem was that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t controlled the number of times a location can serve as a foil when I had picked the set of object/locations pairs. This is indeed problematic because some locations were used four times. If you know which object was at a specific location, it isn’t really a foil anymore influencing subsequent trials.</description>

      <title>Change of design based on pilot study</title>
      <link>https://jaquent.github.io/2018/01/change-of-design-based-on-pilot-study/</link>

      <description>I had the vague idea to do multivariate pattern analysis on the mPFC to decode specific schemas and to see how new objects/information is integrated in to those, but the problem might be that there are far too few trials to do that with the current design. It might also be interesting to look at memory reinstatement and how it is influence by schemas.
Today, I met with my supervisor and talked about the current design, about the ratings and general plan for this year.</description>
