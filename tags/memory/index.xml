      <title> End of schemaVR1 and start of schemaVR2</title>

      <description>Today, I finished the data collection for schemaVR1. I collected 17 instead of 16 participants because I wanted to show the experiment to someone who then agreed to formally take part in this experiment.
The two major the results of this experiment are that the locations of objects that are generally unexpected in a kitchen are remembered better (measured by 3D location recall and 3AFC location recognition) than the locations of objects that are expected in a kitchen.</description>

      <description>I am currently caught up with collecting data for my first experiment, which I will henceforth call schemaVR1, working on my first year report and analysing the interim results. I have collected data from eight participant so far and already got number of significant results. This is quite impressive considering that I also have only twenty stimuli/trials. I will upload the pre-processing script alongside a script analysing the interim results in the next days in a separate GitHub repository, where I will provide more details, but a very robust, and already significant, finding is that the locations of unexpected objects are recalled more often than that of expected objects.</description>

      <title>Issue with stimulus selection and some thoughts</title>

      <description>This entry contains thoughts and observations for the last couple of days because I was stuck with a problem and didn’t have a lot say. The problem was that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t controlled the number of times a location can serve as a foil when I had picked the set of object/locations pairs. This is indeed problematic because some locations were used four times. If you know which object was at a specific location, it isn’t really a foil anymore influencing subsequent trials.</description>

      <title>Recognition instructions for recollection and familiarity</title>

      <description>Following feedback I changed the instruction for the recognition task so that they are in line with Bastin et al. (2014). The respective part of the instruction were changed to:
 If you pressed &amp;lt;&amp;lt;y&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for yes, you will need to indicate whether you recollected this by pressing &amp;lt;&amp;lt;r&amp;gt;&amp;gt; or whether this object was only familiar by pressing &amp;lt;&amp;lt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt;. You recollected an object if you see it and recall specific details about it (e.</description>

      <title>Lab meeting</title>

      <description>During our weekly lab meeting I got the following feedback pertaining to project 1 (schema-memory-VR; see here):
 I should drop mixed condition and only use unexpected or expected locations to reduce the number of conditions. Another idea was to present objects in a sequence in order to create a temporal episode. It could be interesting in this context to look at the fragmentation hypothesis (Horner &amp;amp; Burgess, 2013, 2014) and see how my VR approach can be use to examine predictions of it.</description>

      <title>HPC activity and graphics in Unity</title>

      <description>Frankland et al. (2005) reviews that HPC ripple activity is temporally correlated with cortical slow-wave spindles in the MPFC. This could be related to the integration of memories into existing schema. Unity tutorial on graphics:  If I want to spawn objects at random locations, it would be problematic to pre-compute the lighting. Would it be a solution to be used mixed baking and have all the items, which do not change their location, as static because they have light maps?</description>
