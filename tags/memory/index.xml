      <description>Following feedback I changed the instruction for the recognition task so that they are in line with Bastin et al. (2014). The respective part of the instruction were changed to:
 If you pressed &amp;lt;&amp;lt;y&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for yes, you will need to indicate whether you recollected this by pressing &amp;lt;&amp;lt;r&amp;gt;&amp;gt; or whether this object was only familiar by pressing &amp;lt;&amp;lt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt;. You recollected an object if you see it and recall specific details about it (e.</description>

      <description>During our weekly lab meeting I got the following feedback pertaining to project 1 (schema-memory-VR; see here):
 I should drop mixed condition and only use unexpected or expected locations to reduce the number of conditions. Another idea was to present objects in a sequence in order to create a temporal episode. It could be interesting in this context to look at the fragmentation hypothesis (Horner &amp;amp; Burgess, 2013, 2014) and see how my VR approach can be use to examine predictions of it.</description>

      <title>HPC activity and graphics in Unity</title>

      <description>Frankland et al. (2005) reviews that HPC ripple activity is temporally correlated with cortical slow-wave spindles in the MPFC. This could be related to the integration of memories into existing schema.Unity tutorial on graphics:If I want to spawn objects at random locations, it would be problematic to pre-compute the lighting.Would it be a solution to be used mixed baking and have all the items, which do not change their location, as static because they have light maps?</description>
