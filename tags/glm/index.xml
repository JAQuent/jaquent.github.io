      <description>Prelude Sources that I found useful General libraries Simple linear regression Multiple linear regression Special cases One sample t-test Two sample t-test Paired t-test Two-way ANOVA Does the contrast weighting matter for the test-statistics? Covariance matrix of the residuals A example design matrix for fMRI Multiple testing problem Calculate FWE FWE correction Random field theory Permutation tests FDR Conclusion Glossary Prelude I was revisiting some of the basics surrounding fMRI especially the GLM and contrasts.</description>

      <description>Aim of this document The aim of this document is to accompany the design analysis for noveltyVR (see here) and to shed light on the deliberations concerning the planned analysis.
The planned design is a 2 x 2 x 2 design with one between and two within subject factors. There will be a novelty and a control group (Factor N) and we will examine recollection/familiarity (Factor M) for weakly/strongly learned words (Factor E).</description>
