      <description>Aim of this document Instead of frequentist statistics as planned previously, we decided to use a Bayesian framework more specifically a Sequential Bayesian Factor (SBF) analysis to examine whether the experience of novelty can enhance memory for unrelated information.
Nevertheless, I also report the power analysis that I ran, in which I am determining the necessary sample size to find an effect with a power of 95 % based on the results of Fenker et al.</description>

      <description>Aim Here, I am selecting 200 words for a new project called noveltyVR, in which I am going to try to study the effect of novelty on something that was learned before. In this case, it will be a list of words that were incidentally encoded in a living/non-living judgement task. I will select 200 words from a published study, look up their properties in the MRC Psycholinguistic Database and create two lists that are used as old and new stimuli in a recognition task.</description>
