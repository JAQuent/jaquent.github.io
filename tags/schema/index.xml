      <description>During our weekly lab meeting I got the following feedback pertaining to project 1 (schema-memory-VR; see here):
 I should drop mixed condition and only use unexpected or expected locations to reduce the number of conditions. Another idea was to present objects in a sequence in order to create a temporal episode. It could be interesting in this context to look at the fragmentation hypothesis (Horner &amp;amp; Burgess, 2013, 2014) and see how my VR approach can be use to examine predictions of it.</description>

      <description>After examining the stimuli photos from Lew &amp;amp; Howe (2016), I came to the conclusion that even schema-irrelevant objects have more or less expected locations. For instance, placing boots in the middle of the kitchen is unusual, but putting a hat on the kitchen table is less so.
Reference Lew, A. R., &amp;amp; Howe, M. L. (2016). Out of Place, Out of Mind: Schema-Driven False Memory Effects for Object-Location Bindings.</description>
