      <description>Introduction Comparing the four BF methods Evidence for null hypothesis: brms vs. ttestBF() How much more conservative is the bmrs approach? Directed vs. non-directed hypothesis Conclusion  Introduction In this post, I’d like to examine how different ways to calcualte Bayes factors (BF) compare with each other for a simple model. This simulation was run on my department’s HPC using the rslurm package: the corresponding R code, data and .</description>

      <description>Outset of the problem I recently discussed generating data for a power/design analysis and the following problem came up. Does the standard deviation (SD) has an influence on the test statistics (t-value, p-value, BF) under the null hypothesis? The noise in the or the SD of the data should have no effect. To understand this, look at Cohen&amp;rsquo;s D, which is the mean divided by the SD. Under the null hypothesis will always be zero because the mean is zero regardless how big the SD is.</description>

      <title>Design analysis for noveltyVR</title>

      <description>Aim of this document The aim of this document is to conduct a design analysis for a fixed N design using one-sided Bayesian t-test. This analysis will inform our choice of N for a registered report. The planned experiment is a 2 x 2 x 2 design with one between- and two within-subject factors. Without going into too much detail, there will be a novelty and a control group (Factor N) and we will examine recollection/familiarity (Factor M) for weakly/strongly learned words (Factor E).</description>

      <description>Aim of this document The aim of this document is to accompany the design analysis for noveltyVR (see here) and to shed light on the deliberations concerning the planned analysis.
