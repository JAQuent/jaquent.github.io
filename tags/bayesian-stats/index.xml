      <description>The outset of the problem In one of my project, I’d like to show that there is a U-shape relationship between two variables. The traditional way to do this would be to fit a quadratic model and test whether the quadratic term is different from zero. However, Simonsohn (2018) among other correctly points out that evidence for a quadratic fit is not enough and there might be situations where the quadratic term is not zero but there is no true u-shape.</description>

      <description>Introduction Comparing the four BF methods Evidence for null hypothesis: brms vs. ttestBF() How much more conservative is the bmrs approach? Directed vs. non-directed hypothesis Conclusion Introduction In this post, I’d like to examine how different ways to calcualte Bayes factors (BF) compare with each other for a simple model.</description>
