      <description>Preface This work documents my attempt to understand the model structure of mixed linear models or multilevel models. I adapted a formula that I found on Wikipedia and work myself through the different models and test whether I am able to retrieve the different parameters with lmerTest. Bodo Winter&amp;rsquo;s tutorial on the lme was very useful for this. The main motivation for doing all this is to use basically model 5 in my analysis of my first experiment.</description>
