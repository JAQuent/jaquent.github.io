      <description>Preface Note: This is an old post from my early PhD time that I slightly edited but share again because it would be interesting to one or two people.
This work documents my attempt to understand the model structure of mixed linear models or multilevel models. I adapted a formula that I found on Wikipedia and work myself through the different models and test whether I am able to retrieve the different parameters with lmerTest.</description>
