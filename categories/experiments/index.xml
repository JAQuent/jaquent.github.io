      <description>The problem While analysing the data from our U-shape experiments (see pre-registration for context: https://osf.io/kcr2q), we ran into a peculiar problem. As expected, we did find that memory performance can be described as a U-shape function of how expected a certain object is in certain location. However, we also predicted that the memory advantage for highly incongruent item/locations pairings as well as for highly congruent pairings are driven by different processes.</description>

      <description>Introduction In order to be able to present object at locations with a range of expectancy values, which is crucial to show that this has U-shaped relationship, I asked six member of my research group. to rate all combinations of objects and location that exist in the virtual environment for the schemaVR task.</description>
