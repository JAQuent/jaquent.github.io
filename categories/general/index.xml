      <title>A way to get MNI coordinates for subcortical voxels of a CIFTI file</title>

      <description>What do I want to do? In this post, I will demonstrate how it is possible to use the R packages cifti and ciftiTools to get the MNI coordinates of the subcortical voxels in your CIFTI file. This table can then be used to select voxels based on their coordinates and do further things with them like creating masks.</description>

      <description>In my last post a while back, I showed how to load a .json file in to Unity3D without using UXF, which if you can do this, is still the easiest way for experiments. One of the problems with UXF however is that you cannot access the .json file before starting UXF&amp;rsquo;s session, which is exactly the problem that I ran into here.</description>

      <description>In this post, I quickly show a way to load data into Unity3D using a simple .json file. Note there are other &amp;amp; for the most part simpler ways if you use UXF - Unity Experiment Framework, which provide a way to parse on data via .json out of the box.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with different materials and shaders in Unity recently. One problem is that especially if you want use the same texture for the same large object you get these nasty tiling effects:
Luckily, I found this obscure shader on Unity&amp;rsquo;s GitHub page, which is amazing but it asked for something called a map texture, which took me ages to figure out.</description>

      <title>Finding a U-shape with Bayesian interrupted regression</title>

      <description>The outset of the problem In one of my project, I’d like to show that there is a U-shape relationship between two variables. The traditional way to do this would be to fit a quadratic model and test whether the quadratic term is different from zero. However, Simonsohn (2018) among other correctly points out that evidence for a quadratic fit is not enough and there might be situations where the quadratic term is not zero but there is no true u-shape.</description>

      <title>The priors that I use for logistic regression now</title>

      <description>Problem In my power simulation of the U-shape experiment, I noticed that the suggested priors (click here) actually do not work very well for Bayes Factor (BF) analysis as they are too flat and hence BF are too conservative. That is because uniform or very flat priors lead to less evidence in favour of the alternative hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Bayesian sequential designs are superior</title>

      <description>This post is based on a short talk that I gave at the MRC CBU on the 29 July 2020 for a session on statistical power. The slides of presentation can be found in my GitHub repository. This repository also includes the data and the scripts that were used to run the simulations and to create the figures.</description>

      <description>Introduction Comparing the four BF methods Evidence for null hypothesis: brms vs. ttestBF() How much more conservative is the bmrs approach? Directed vs. non-directed hypothesis Conclusion Introduction In this post, I’d like to examine how different ways to calcualte Bayes factors (BF) compare with each other for a simple model.</description>

      <title>Understanding mixed linear models</title>

      <description>Preface Note: This is an old post from my early PhD time that I slightly edited but share again because it would be interesting to one or two people.
This work documents my attempt to understand the model structure of mixed linear models or multilevel models. I adapted a formula that I found on Wikipedia and work myself through the different models and test whether I am able to retrieve the different parameters with lmerTest.</description>
